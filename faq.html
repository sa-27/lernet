 		        <h3><br>What is Artemis?</h3>
 		        <p>The Artemis Project is a five-week summer program founded in 1996 at <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/orgs/artemis" target="new">Brown University</a>. Artemis introduces rising 9th grade girls to computer science, targeting them at the critical age when the disparity between males and females in the sciences becomes most pronounced.                 </p>
             <br>
 		        <p>Accepted applicants will be asked to pay a $100 registration fee. </p>
 		        <p><br>
	           <span class="style1"><h3>When/where does Artemis take place?</h3></p>
	           <p>Artemis 2021 will be offered online from July 5 - 30, 2021, Monday through Friday, 9:30 am-12:00 pm and 1:00-3:30 pm. All sessions will be conducted on zoom.</p>
 		        <p><br>
 		          When is the deadline?</p>
        <p>The deadline for completed applications is May 1st. We first need to receive a student's application, followed by an essay and two recommendations. We must receive all materials by May 1st in order for a student to be considered for the program.<br>
 		          <br>
 		        </p>
	           <p>&nbsp;</p>
 		        <h3>How will I know if my application is complete and all my materials have been received.</h3>
 		        <p>Once you apply, you will receive a link that you can use to track the status of your application at any time. You will also be notified when each of your recommenders submit their recommendations for you.</p>
	           <p>&nbsp;</p>
 		        <h3><br>What will I learn?</h3>
	           <p>We will learn computer literacy through the use of programs such as App Inventor and Scratch, or learning the basics of computer programming through web design in HTML, as well as how to program in Python programming language. Students will be introduced to the more theoretical aspects of computer science. and will cover topics such as Cryptography and Artificial Intelligence through games and other hands-on activities. The schedule varies somewhat from year to year, but you can see what participants did last summer by viewing the <a href="schedule.html">2020 schedule</a><a href="/schedule.html"></a>. </p>

	           <h3><br>What else will I do at Artemis?</h3>
 		        <p>Artemis will also have a variety of guest speakers. They will include representatives from our industry sponsors, BU professors and researchers, and other prominent women in the sciences. </p>
 		        <br>
 		        <p>Finally, at the end of the program, we will hold a special event where all students will present the work they have done over the course of the program. </p>
           <br>
 		        <p>By the end of the program, you will have had a rigorous introduction to many different applications of computer science and technology, and to the creative way of thinking and problem-solving that is prominent in the field of computer science. You will leave Artemis with both the practical skills and the conceptual background that will help you follow your interests, in whatever direction they may lead you.</p>
 		        <br>
 		        <h3>Who can apply?</h3>
	           <p>Creative and motivated girls who are curious about math, science, or computers and are entering 9th grade in the fall at a school in the greater Boston area are qualified to apply. No prior computer experience is necessary! </p>
